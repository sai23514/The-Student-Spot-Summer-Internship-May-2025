##  🏦 Simple Banking System in C++

> A C++ console application that simulates a basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Supports user account creation, PIN authentication, deposit/withdraw operations, transaction history, and admin-level account views.


## 📦 Features

- ✅ Object-Oriented Structure (Account, Bank classes)
- 🔒 Secure PIN authentication for each account
- 💰 Deposit & Withdrawal with balance validation
- 📜 Transaction history log per account
- 📋 Admin: View all accounts
- 💾 Save account data to .txt file

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

Encapsulation: Private data members + public methods
Abstraction: Interfaces to operate on accounts
Composition: Bank contains multiple Account instances
Reusability: Modular design for scaling features

## 📌 Future Improvements

🏷 Expense categories and budget tracking
📊 Graphical stats using CLI charts
📡 File encryption or database integration (SQLite/JSON)
🤝‍Multi-user session support
